		Thoughts and learning outcomes INF112 - Group 2


We have learned a lot about teamwork, and what is important to prioritize.

The most important thing we have learned is that it is hard to keep people in the loop, so that everyone will contribute equally.
Especially we have noticed that when a person creates some code, other struggle to understand it. This can be countered with good javadoc 
and that the person who created the code sits down with the person who needs help.

We have also learned about prioritizing work correctly, about what not to bother working on and what we should be working more on.

We have learned a lot about server/client relations and javafx. Javafx is not good to create games with(especially with FXML)

What team method we liked the most, we would say Scrum. Short meatings, fast temp where whe go through the most important parts.
Also to have short presentations of code to make it easier to understand for others.

This has been a fun experience, which we have learned a lot from.
