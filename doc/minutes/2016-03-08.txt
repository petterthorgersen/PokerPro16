\b0 \
\
-- What does 'game' and 'register' mean?\
Register means that you register to games from the main menu.\

We can choose as we want to whether or not we can play against AI and players at the same time.\

Doesn\'92t have to, but can be added as a non-functional requirement.\

Depends on implementation, could be put as alternate paths instead.\
