Retrospect from sprint 2:
-What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
--> Focus on not pushing any critical code a few minutes before deadline(like sprint 1).
-What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
--> We didn't focus enough on deliverables. Need to organize this better
--> The design model didn't contain enough information. Looked too much like a domain model.
-What could we do differently to improve?
--> Not wait until the last minutes before finishing the documentation
--> Better JavaDoc on methods and classes

End notes:
-Pull before pushing!
