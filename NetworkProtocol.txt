			Table of content:
			
			1. What does it need to do
			2. Syntax and network protocol
			3. Examples


			
	1. The protocol needs to be able to send information from client to server and server to client, this information must be written so that
	   they understand each other. 

	2. The protocol is using tcp connection from Java, the server will be a java tcp server and the clients are java clients. 
		
		Syntax: [playerID;action;message] 
		This is currently used as a string, maybe we should use xml ?
		
		playerID: this is a uuid that defines a specific player for that table, it can also be the table itself, then you write [ table ].
		
		action: 
			move (the standard command for bet, call raise, loose, stack, pot etc.)
			chat (send chat message)
		
		message: This is the specific message of the action, 
			raise xxx (raise value xxx)
			call
			check
			Xxx (ig. h14 is hearts 14)
			pot x (set pot to x)
			stack xxx ( player playerID wins xxx chips )

		special cases:

			HandShake:
				Client -> master
				Server -> yes (if master)/ no (else)
				Client -> ok
				Server -> table;1;4;6  (There is 1 table with 4 / 6 players max
				Client -> join 1 (join table 1)
				Server -> ok join 1( confirmed you are part of game 1
				
			Handshake finished.

			if messsage is only one of these:
				bye (Player disconnect)
			

	3. Examples:
		
		3;move;bet 30 - means player 3 bets 30
                3;move;h14 c2 - player 3 pocket is ace of hearts and 2 of clover
                table;move;pot 0 - table removes pot
                7;move;stack 300 - player 7 wins 300 chips
                9;move;loose - player 9 loose
