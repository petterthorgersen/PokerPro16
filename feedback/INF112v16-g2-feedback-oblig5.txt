INF112 programming project iteration 3 - Feedback group 2
=========================================================
Note: The following refers to archive version: d20cc96bf25d71034266ec7e356fa581e7a6c13e


# User requirements specification [1/1]

# Glossary [1/2]
* could have been updated after the second sprint (terms for a network game, etc.)

# Use Case Diagram [3/3]
* has been updated. Note that the layout is usually slightly different.

# Use Case specification (for Network Game) [6/6]
* good use case text and extensions! (Discussion of the double role of Organizer/Player)

# The communication diagram [10/10]
* good!

# Domain model [5.5/7]
* SHowing the different parts of the system (backend, frontend, network) in the diagram is a good idea!
* this shows nicely the communication between the different parts but makes the lower part a bit harder to read, too
* you should leave out methods in the domain model (upper part)
* some role names are missing in the upper part (frontend)

# Design Model [12.5/14]
* the design model is basically an extension of the domain model here
* it contains the most important information on the classes
* however, some important attributes (with types) could be added in the classes
* also, for the messages between classes there should be information on what was exchanged (contents of messages)


# Source code + documentation [29/31]
* Javadoc was generated for all code - very good for an overview
* the code is well organized and documented
* the requested features for this sprint were implemented but some bugs remain to be fixed


# Build script [1.5/2]
* the build script takes a long time (~2m on my laptop) but compiles without errors


# Unit tests [6/8]
* there could be a few more test cases, (e.g. for the network game) but the main game logic was tested 
(game AI vs AI, event-handling, showdown evaluation, Hand calculation)


# Project management [4/7]
* the sprint backlog is still in the old form (was disussed).
* the minutes could be more frequent (also for "non-official" meetings), especially for the last sprint.
* A retrospect for the last iteration was included.

# Presentation [8/9]
* the presentation was good overall (including the very nice game presentation).
You thought of what to present and provided opportunities for the other attendants to interact. 
You also discussed the major points we asked for.
* Given how large your group is, you could have used even more time on discussing the deliverables and
the group experience

# Extra [5/5]
* overall the game design, menus, soundtrack and user friendliness is very good, making it a nice game experience.
