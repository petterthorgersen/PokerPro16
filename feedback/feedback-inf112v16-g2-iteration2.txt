=========================================================

# Deliverables [38/45]
- in the use case diagram: is "play against AI" = "Singleplayer" (not "heads up" but playing against >1 Player)?
- new use case text for single player + extensions -> good!
- I couldn't find an SSD for one of the alternative paths...
- In the use case diagram it is a bit confusing to have three different types of players, which do not seem to be related to
one another (does e.g. AIPlayer and/or GUIPlayer inherit from Player?). Some association/role names are missing
- Some of these comments also apply to the Design model.
-- Does the Player class have no (important) methods?
-- How complex/important is the showdown evaluator class here? 

# Code & Implementation [37/39]
- All features of the current sprint are covered. However, sometimes there are some instabilities during gameplay, e.g.:
-- chip bar for betting does not display correclty
-- the player's bet is not shown (always zero - I assume it's just peanuts for Mr. Trump).


# Project organization [10/10]
- you have the biggest group so it is nice to see that you organize yourself in teams and try to include everyone. 
- Make sure that after the last iteration everyone is up-to-date with the implementation of the latest game version (important for exam question)


# Presentation [6/6]
- Presentation was very good, maybe just a bit too long. Try to stick to the 10-15min (including Discussion)

# general comments
- Thanks for hinting at the delivery commit! ;)

# Extra: +2P
-- +1 for having a research & development team!
-- cheatsheet and help log/player's chat
-- nice game layout 


# Total score #1: 93	

# Total score #2: 85

# Final score: 89
