Feedback INF112 oblig3 group2
=============================

# Clarifications
* The grading is based on the latest archive version before March 16th, 9pm
* Please find individual markings for the documentation, code and presentation below (with comments if needed)
* Everyone in the group will receive the same score for this compulsory assignment (the group should divide the work in a self-organized way) 
* However, if it becomes evident that only a few members are actively contributing to the project, we reserve the possibility to deduct points
for team members that contribute very little.  

# Documentation [45.5/50]
* The use case text is fine but I think some of the details don't correspond to the current implementation (yet?); Also the alternatives to happy path should
be extended
* SSDs are fine, but the SSD for happy path different from singleplayer?
* operation contracts look generally good but could the playerAction could be a specific one rather than generic
* The Domain model looks very good including multiplicities and role names and has only small imperfections 
(player hand of 5 cards -> discussed in class, ? at the
card<->board relation)
* It would be good if you could stick to either Norwegian or English (preferrably) as language for documentation (e.g. the Glossary)
* the installation instructions should be updated (use of gridlew, etc.)

# Code + build script [28.5/34]
* build script: produces error when running build (with tests), executing the "run" target works though
* code is generally well organized but the purpose of code in some files is at times difficult to understand

# Project mangement [9/11]
* minutes are generally good but could have a common format to keep track of things more easily (e.g. structure according to Doc, code with subtasks, general discussion, etc.)

# presentation [5/5]
* waitingForPlayers with project vision (good idea!)
* Domain model - Players hand is just 2 cards, but the current score of 5 hypothetical cards could be displayed (in future iterations)
* The game demonstration was good in general, but sometimes a bit fast (hard to follow)
I think you discussed to intregate some sort of delay for the showdown and that is definitely a good idea!
* some game mechanics need to be updated (minus chips?)

# Extra [+2] 
* extra: game can be run without GUI

# general comments
* in general the archive is well organized
* but: consider cleaning up the files that are not needed anymore 
- thanks to git we can always get them back (no need for "achive" or workfiles, etc.)
